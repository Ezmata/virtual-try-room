*This virtual dressing room  is the online equivalent of an in-store changing room. It enables shoppers to try on clothes to check one or more of size, fit or style, but virtually rather than physically.*
*A fit technology may be categorised according to the problem that it resolves (size, fit or styling) or according to the technological approach. There are many different types of technological approach.
The size of the customer is predicted using Machine Learning :Weight,Size,Gender and Age are the parameters which help in deciding the appropriate fitting.* 
*Real 3D Simulation fitting room combines the features of 3D solutions and photo-accurate fitting rooms. Using both photo and simple body measurements, the solution generates a 3D mannequin, which accurately visualizes customer in chosen apparel items.*
